# ChallengePractice

This is a react practice project in which I learned:
        - Handle of Token, Log in procedure and fix issues with the tokens variables
        - How to call an API and render the array of Objects
        - Practice Styling
        - Redux
        - Routing


There are components and pages which aren't used because I changed the aim of this project to unstuck me and keep learning. Also the "Courses" aren't real food, just a copy of an API (which bringed me the real dishes) to know how to handle it but without calling it 'cause it had 150 request for a day.


# How to run it
   -clone or download this repository
   -npm i
   -npm run start

Thank you for viewing my practice project, I'm learning a lot and soon will make a real project, I hope.
